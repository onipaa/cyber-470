Sure, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide to install Security Onion on Ubuntu 22.04 and configure Suricata to monitor and alert on access to `http://10.0.0.141/secure`.

### Step 1: Prepare Your System
Ensure your Ubuntu system is up-to-date.
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install Security Onion
1. **Add the Security Onion repository and install its GPG key:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gnupg2 curl
    curl -o /usr/share/keyrings/securityonion.gpg https://packages.securityonion.net/securityonion.gpg
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/securityonion.gpg] https://packages.securityonion.net/repo focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/securityonion.list
    ```

2. **Update the package list and install Security Onion:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install securityonion -y
    # could not find that package
    wget https://cdn.securityonionsolutions.com/files/securityonion.iso

    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/soiso
    sudo mount -o loop securityonion.iso /mnt/soiso

    cd /mnt/soiso

### 2.4.80-20240624 ISO image released on 2024/06/25


### Download and Verify

2.4.80-20240624 ISO image:  
https://download.securityonion.net/file/securityonion/securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso
 
MD5: 139F9762E926F9CB3C4A9528A3752C31  
SHA1: BC6CA2C5F4ABC1A04E83A5CF8FFA6A53B1583CC9  
SHA256: 70E90845C84FFA30AD6CF21504634F57C273E7996CA72F7250428DDBAAC5B1BD  

Signature for ISO image:  
https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/raw/2.4/main/sigs/securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso.sig

Signing key:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/2.4/main/KEYS  

For example, here are the steps you can use on most Linux distributions to download and verify our Security Onion ISO image.

Download and import the signing key:  
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/2.4/main/KEYS -O - | gpg --import -  
```

Download the signature file for the ISO:  
```
wget https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/raw/2.4/main/sigs/securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso.sig
```

Download the ISO image:  
```
wget https://download.securityonion.net/file/securityonion/securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso
```

Verify the downloaded ISO image using the signature file:  
```
gpg --verify securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso.sig securityonion-2.4.80-20240624.iso
```

The output should show "Good signature" and the Primary key fingerprint should match what's shown below:
```
gpg: Signature made Mon 24 Jun 2024 02:42:03 PM EDT using RSA key ID FE507013
gpg: Good signature from "Security Onion Solutions, LLC <info@securityonionsolutions.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: C804 A93D 36BE 0C73 3EA1  9644 7C10 60B7 FE50 7013
```

If it fails to verify, try downloading again. If it still fails to verify, try downloading from another computer or another network.

Once you've verified the ISO image, you're ready to proceed to our Installation guide:

3. **Run the Security Onion setup:**
    ```bash
    sudo so-setup
    ```
    Follow the prompts to configure Security Onion. Select the appropriate options for your deployment type.

### Step 3: Configure Suricata
1. **Locate the Suricata configuration directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /opt/so/saltstack/local/salt/suricata/
    ```

2. **Create a custom Suricata rule file:**
    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/nsm/rules/local.rules
    ```
    Add the following rule to alert on access to `http://10.0.0.141/secure`:
    ```plain
    alert http any any -> 10.0.0.141 80 (msg:"Access to /secure detected"; uri_content:"/secure"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
    ```

3. **Verify and reload Suricata rules:**
    ```bash
    sudo suricata-update
    sudo so-rule-update
    sudo so-sensor-restart
    ```

### Step 4: Verify Suricata is Running
1. **Check the status of Suricata:**
    ```bash
    sudo so-status
    ```

2. **Test the rule by accessing `http://10.0.0.141/secure` from a different machine on the network and checking if alerts are generated.**

### Step 5: Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Access Security Onion's web interface (Kibana) to monitor alerts:**
    Open a web browser and navigate to the Security Onion web interface using the IP address or hostname of your Security Onion server.

2. **Log in and go to the "Alerts" section to view any alerts generated by Suricata.**

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the firewall allows traffic on necessary ports for Security Onion and Suricata.
- Regularly update Suricata rules and Security Onion components.
- Fine-tune your rules and configurations as needed to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.

This should set up Security Onion with Suricata to alert on access to `http://10.0.0.141/secure`. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
